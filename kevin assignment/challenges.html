        <H1> Challenges</H1>
        <p>the biggest challenge that i have ever faced as a young man growing on the street
        is the challenge influenced by my peers which include drug abuse and life of being involved 
        with the street gang, but with God and  strict parents plus with my own personal experience 
        helped me to overcome all the my biggest challenges</p>
